The main difference between let and const in JavaScript is that let allows variable reassignment, while const creates variables with a constant, unchangeable value.

Variable Assignment:

With let, you can assign a new value to the variable.
With const, the initial assignment is mandatory, and the variable cannot be reassigned a new value.
Variable Mutability:

Variables declared with let are mutable, meaning their value can be modified.
Variables declared with const are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after assignment.
In summary, the main difference between let and const lies in their mutability and reassignment capabilities. let allows reassignment and mutable values, while const creates variables with a constant, unchangeable value. It's a good practice to use let when you know the variable value needs to change, and const when the value is intended to remain constant.
