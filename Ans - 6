Template literals, introduced in ES6, are an enhanced string syntax that allows for more expressive and flexible string interpolation in JavaScript. They provide a convenient way to embed expressions and variables inside strings using backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

To use template literals, you enclose the string content within backticks instead of traditional quotes. Within the template literal, you can embed placeholders, denoted by ${}, which can contain JavaScript expressions, variables, or function calls. The placeholders are then replaced with their corresponding values when the template literal is evaluated.
Template literals also support escaping characters with the backslash (\) to include special characters or include backticks within the string.

Overall, template literals provide a concise and flexible way to create strings with embedded expressions, variables, or function calls. They make string interpolation more convenient and readable, particularly when dealing with complex or multiline strings.
